Intro:
	1. Coding game.
	2. Coding game example: 
		a. Brief intro of the challenge : drive, turn, clone actions, one exited clone to win
		b. https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/don't-panic-episode-1
	3. Program.cs = 1 file : very clutered!!!
	4. Why? A: algorithm and clean code exercise.
		
Don't panic episode 1

A. "win with crappy code coverage"
	1. git checkout d2912dcb33cf074f671a6a96b55e4e57426c2b3e
	2. Code design : Elevator, DriveParams, TurnParams, CloneMaster, Drive, TurnDecision, Direction
	3. Tests : 
		a. ElevatorTest, DriveParamsTest, TurnParamsTest : unit tests.
		b. DriveTest : acceptance tests, unit tests.
		c. Tools :
			1. ConsoleSimulator with ConsoleSimulatorTest
			2. Direction.EXIT
	4. DriveTest :
		a. acceptance tests
		b. still, hard to follow
	5. CloneMaster
		a. complex, hard to read
		b. CloneMaster.Decide : 5 ifs with same return type
		c. logic is hidden in technical code
		----> needed a dedicated "space" to express the business logic

B. "refactored CloneMaster.Decide into implementations ofTurnDecisionBase"
	1. git checkout 345e19ff30f494c920a9a89ffccf1a17f712524f
	2. Strategy pattern to decide turn decision logic.
	3. Presentation focus : TurnDecisionsFactory > CloneMaster > TurnDecisionBase
		a. logic was divided, but :
			1. Not unit tested
			2. Technical logic in descendants of TurnDecisionBase
			3. TurnDecisionBase : too many statics! Statics are not objects members...
		b. lots of unit tests to write ?!
			1. Duplicated code!
			2. Code symetries!
			
C. Refactoring & unit testing
	0. Lazyness is great!
	1. statics from TurnDecisionBase -> member methods with simple unit tests
		- "Refactored code into TurnDecisionBase.IsHeadingInOppositeDirection"
		- "Refactored code into TurnDecisionBase.Are0ClonesBlockedOnFloor"
		- "extracted code to TurnDecisionBase.IsNearPreviousElevator"
		- "IsHeadingInOppositeDirection is now a member of TurnParams"
		- "moved IsCloneNearPreviousElevator into TurnParams"
		- ""
	2. removed code : "removed check of clone neing on the current floor"
	
D. "created build and expanded one class per file"
	1. git checkout d5ee7bfa45cbbc0f579c389ff549b7558673ac16
	2. Build project : codingame.dont.panic.build
	3. Separate files : clearer business logic
	
E. "100% coverage on TurnParams" - false!
	1. git checkout bfba2d1ba0fdbc18381194a73472f2702ac75d28
	2. Business logic disperses to business objects:
		a. TurnParams
		b. BlockCloneIfGoingLeftAndElevatorIsOnRight

F. "no need to check Are0ClonesBlockedOnFloor" & "removed clonesBlockedPerFloor array"
	1. Removed useless code detectected by:
		a. Unit tests &	100% code coverage
		c. Code analysis
		d. Brutalizing code and running unit tests
			1. Feature not covered by specific unit tests & 100% code coverage -> probably useless code
		
G. "Fully covered TurnParams" by TurnParamsTest only!!!
	1. git checkout 500f5d5415df1af82c5a64561659fd548b826c47
	2. Business logic disperses to business objects:
		a. TurnParams -> a "business center"
		b. TurnDecisionBase
		c. BlockCloneBeforeColision
	3. Removed code duplication :
		a. BlockCloneIfGoingLeftAndElevatorIsOnRight
		b. BlockCloneIfGoingLeftAndExitIsOnRight
		c. BlockCloneIfGoingRightAndElevatorIsOnLeft
		d. BlockCloneIfGoingRightAndExitIsOnLeft
		e. to BlockCloneIfGoingOppositeOfObjective

I. Final code
	1. git checkout master
	2. Solution overlook:
		a. Drive class: business connector
		b. TurnParams: main logic
		c. TurnParamsTest: unit testing one logic at a time
	3. TurnDecision.EXIT replaced by NoMoreLinesToReadException
	4. codingame.common.build.submit.file
		a. load referenced projects
		

Conclusion:
	1. Code design : "Design fullfills a need"
		a. Feature : client need first
		b. Readability (maintainance) : business logic > technical expression
		c. Non-regression : tests
	2. Tests :
		a. Acceptance tests (feature):
			1. High level
			2. Readability!?
		b. Unit tests
			1. Test a unit (what's a unit?), one service at a time, one scenario at a time
			2. Very fast (tenths of miliseconds...)
		c. Non-regression
	3. Tools:
		a. Resharper (defines a uniform style over code):
			1. Macros (ctorp, ctorf)
			2. Tips (readonly...)
			3. Shourtcuts
			4. Refactoring (rename...)
			5. Instant code analysis
		b. Linq
		c. NFluent (Nuget) : simple, fluent assertions (simple types, collections, exceptions, async)
		d. MsTest:
			1. Unit test manager
			2. Code coverage analyser
